# License

Picking a license for soemthing like this is tricky.  I want it to be open source and available for everyone, but don't want companies profiting of something I designed without paying a fair percentage to acknowledge the time spent designing such boards.

So, what do I do!? 

Here's my brief thoughts....

# NON COMMERCIAL USES

I want these designs to benefit the hobbyists.  If you want to have a board made, I personally use JLCPCB.  Simply download the gerber files and have a batch made.

# COMMERCIAL USES

When it comes to commercial use, having a "non-commercial" caveat goes against the open source hardware concept.
So as a compromise, I humbly ask, that IF you intend to produce and sell my boards;

1) MAKE A FAIR DONATION

2) Give me full credit for the design and point people to this github repository.

It is a humble request and as such is not enforced but I implore you (you, being a company) to appreciate the time put into designing these and make a donation.
